# zigbee2mqtt_E800

# WARNING: AFTER SOME TIME I FOUND OUT THAT KOENKK'S FIRMWARE HAS HUGE AMOUNT OF MODIFICATION FROM THE ORIGINAL. IF YOU ARE GONNA TRY THIS YOU NEED TO APPLY HIS PATCH TO THE CODE FIRST THEN FOLLOW `Modifications.md` TO CHANGE OTHER MODIFIED PARTS MANUALLY!

# ALSO I DO NOT HAVE THIS DEVICE ON HAND ANYMORE. I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST SWITCH TO CC2652P SINCE IT'S MUCH POWERFUL THAN CC2530 AND THERE ALREADY EXIST [MATURE FIRMWARES](https://github.com/egony/cc2652p_E72-2G4M20S1E)!

(Testing and Unstable) ZStack firmware build for E-Byte E800-DTU using with zigbee2mqtt

Initiated from https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/4248

**Seems like TI's source code license does not allow me to distribute the entire project. I'll be sharing what I modified before as a document and diff file, also providing the compiled HEX file here.**
